Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================================

This program uses a single R script to create a single data set containing the mean and std measurements for the training and testing groups.  

It then changes the activity code to descriptive names and renames the columns to be more readable. 

(This cleaned data set is stored in the variable "complete", and exported as "tidy-data-set.csv")

Finally, it aggregates the data set to return the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.

(This data set is stored in the variable cAvg, and exported as "tidy-data-set2.csv")
